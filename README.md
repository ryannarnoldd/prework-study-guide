# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is a study guide for the prework section of the coding bootcamp. This guide features notes and features implemented by HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript, a professional README, and deploying all of this information onto the Internet. This tool will allow students to learn the basics to web development in a simple page that is static and all on one simple page. To get even more information, students are invited to open Google Chrome DevTools to open the console and see what has been logged in the console using JavaScript, a suggestion on what to study first

## Usage

For each of the topics - HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript - are included on the static main page of this website and when a student needs notes and information on each of the topics, they can view them right away on the website. For further examples on the execution of Javascript, users can go to the console section of DevTools in Chrome (by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows)) to view the output of the functions we included in the website. This will provide suggestions on what to study first in the guide.
